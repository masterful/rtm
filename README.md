This is simply my best effort to challenge myself and create a stellar HTML5 application to keep myself on track.

Hopefully you can find it useful too - for some purpose?

###Tools used:
*CodeKit (used to concatenate and minify the less (css) and js files)
*Git (obviously) (used to version this software in case - read "when" - I make a mistake)
*GitHub (to let others see my source code, and to allow them to adore - read "fix" - my code)

###Technologies used:
*HTML (pretty straightforward, I don't really make use of anything wow, but I do strive for HTML5 standards compliance)
*CSS (I make use of CSS3 transitions and may soon use media queries - I also take advantage of a few of the newer selectors - though I believe they may be CSS2)
*JS (Since this application was designed to work in the latest and greatest, it is primarly themed towards a WebKit rendered browser)
